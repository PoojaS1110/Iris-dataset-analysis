# Iris Dataset Analysis
Application of Decision Tree Classifier for Iris Species Classification: A Comparative Analysis with Regression Models

## Summary:
In this project, the Iris dataset was analyzed in relation to data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and classification techniques in an attempt to identify iris species. The notebook shows how data preprocessing and visualization and application of machine learning models were done to understand and predict Iris species by their features.

## Methodology:
Firstly, data cleaning and preprocessing, which deals with missing values, if any, and standardization of a dataset. EDA was done through descriptive statistics and plots such as pair plots and histograms for a feel of the distribution of features and their correlation. Afterward, classification models such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines were implemented to predict iris species. Accuracy, precision, and recall are the metrics through which model performance can be measured.

Scatter plots are only some of the means to be used in visualization for the exploration of relationships of features and model performance. Conclusions from data analysis and model evaluations include summary points, showing insights in terms of trends and patterns obtained from the dataset.

## Skills Used:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Model Evaluation Metrics

## Results:
Detected the key relationships between features and demonstrated successful classification of iris species using different machine learning models. The models obtained high accuracy, thus indicating that the features are strong predictors of iris species. It is such visualization techniques that provide clear insights concerning feature distributions and model performance.
